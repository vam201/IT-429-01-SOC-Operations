- **Purpose:**

This document is designed so that in the event of an attack, all interested parties in the company can be responded to, documented, and informed accordingly as to what happened, how it happened, the measures that were taken to stop the attack, and what will be done in the future so that it does not happen again.

In this case, we are talking about a case of Phishing. Phishing is a type of cyberattack where attackers impersonate legitimate organizations or individuals in order to trick people into revealing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal data. This is usually done through fraudulent emails, messages, or websites that appear to be from trusted sources, such as banks or online services.

The goal of Phishing is to steal confidential data for malicious purposes, such as identity theft or financial fraud. Phishing attacks can take various forms, including:

Email phishing: Fake emails that look like they come from legitimate sources, often containing links or attachments designed to steal information.
Spear phishing: A more targeted form of Phishing where attackers customize their messages to a specific individual or organization.
Vishing: Phishing is conducted through voice calls, where attackers impersonate legitimate entities to ask for personal information.
Smishing: Phishing is done via text messages, often directing recipients to fraudulent websites.
It's essential to be cautious when clicking on links or opening attachments from unknown sources to avoid falling victim to phishing attacks.

- **Scope:** The scope of this document ranges from initial detection to remediation and implementation of a plan to correct the breach, train staff, and improve the use of technology to protect the information and reputation of company stakeholders.
- - Hosts, URLs, Domains, IP, Ports, Files, Hash, Network, Servers

- **Roles and Responsibilities:** 

- **Objective:** The objective of this phase is to identify who the interested parties are and what their responsibilities are. In this way, it is possible to identify who should do what and when.
- **Actions:** The actions in this phase will be determined by each of the assignments according to the role played by each of the stakeholders.
- **Tools and Resources:** The resource for this phase is the responsibility manuals that have been assigned to each team and stakeholders.

- **Detection and Analysis:**

- **Objective:** In the Detection and Analysis phase, steps are taken to identify when a vulnerability is being exploited. More specifically, when a user has received an email containing a phishing link and the user clicked on it, thus initiating a system violation and providing access to a third party with malicious intent.
- **Actions:** During this stage the steps to take are to receive system alerts indicating strange behavior, analyze these reports from the monitoring system and logs received in monitoring systems which will indicate erroneous behavior.
- **Tools and Resources:** The tools to be used are the SIEM server, and other monitoring systems implemented in the company such as IDS, EDR, etc.

- **Containment:**

- **Objective:** The objective of this stage is to be able to stop the attack by ensuring that it does not spread to other places in the network. For example, it is important to ensure that other company devices, computers, servers or other devices that could further spread the attack are not contaminated.
- **Actions:** The actions to be taken are to quarantine the primarily infected device. Identify the email through which the attack was received and quarantine it. Block the sender of the email. Identify the logs in the system to find out if there are any other infected or compromised devices that should be quarantined and removed.
- **Tools and Resources:** The tools are Firewall, EDR, Web Filter, AV, Mail Firewall.

- **Eradication:** 

- **Objective:** Eradication involves completely removing any malware, virus, executable, or temporary or permanent access that the intruder may have gained to the system. The user's computer must be restored, ensuring that there is no trace of any infection or future remote access. The company's other systems are also analyzed to ensure that everything has been returned to normal before the attack occurred.
- **Actions:** The actions to be taken are to completely wipe the compromised user's computer. Review the network and server systems and block any access or IP to which the traffic was directed after the attack.
- **Tools and Resources:** The tools are Firewall, EDR, Web Filter, AV, Mail Firewall.

- **Recovery:** 
-
- **Objective:** At this stage, we will check if any information has been lost, restore data to the user's computer from any backups that have been made, and restore any other system that has been infected.
- **Actions:** Restore information from backup systems to the device and other network and system resources.
- **Tools and Resources:** Company Backup Systems.

- **Post-Incident Activity:** 

- **Objective:** Post-attack activities and the previous stages mentioned are based on what was learned from this attack, what needs to be changed and improved, and the reports that will be made to the company's stakeholders.
- **Actions:** Create policies, train users on a training and awareness plan, report on the scope of the damage caused by the attack and the things that will be done to improve the company's stakeholders. Suggestions will be made to ensure that the appropriate departments implement the policies that need to be changed and implement new solutions and strategies to further protect the company.
- **Tools and Resources:** Reporting documents and training for company resources.
